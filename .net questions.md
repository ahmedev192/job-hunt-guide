### OOPS & C# - Basics

- Q1. What is C#? What is the difference between C# and .NET? 
C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft for building applications. .NET is a framework that provides libraries, runtime, and tools to run C# (and other languages) applications. C# is the language, while .NET is the platform.

- Q2. What is OOPS? What are the main concepts of OOPS? 
OOP is a programming paradigm based on objects and classes. Main concepts:
	- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods, restricting access.
	- Inheritance: Reusing code by deriving classes from a base class.
	- Polymorphism: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their base class or interface.
	- Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details, showing only essentials.

- Q3. What are the advantages of OOPS?
	- Code reusability through inheritance.
	- Better organization with encapsulation.
	- Flexibility via polymorphism.
	- Easier maintenance and scalability.

- Q5. What are Classes and Objects?  
A class is a blueprint defining properties and methods (e.g., class Car { public string Model; }). An object is an instance of a class (e.g., Car myCar = new Car();).

- Q6. What are the types of classes in C#? 
	- Regular Class: Standard class for objects.
	- Static Class: Contains only static members, cannot be instantiated.
	- Abstract Class: Cannot be instantiated, used as a base class.
	- Sealed Class: Cannot be inherited.
	- Partial Class: Splits class definition across files.

- Q7. Is it possible to prevent object creation of a class in C#? 
Yes, by making the constructor private (e.g., private ClassName() { }) or using a static class.

- Q8. What is Property? 
A property is a member that provides a way to read or write a private field, often with getters and setters (e.g., public string Name { get; set; }).

- Q9. What is the difference between Property and Function?
	- Property: Used to get/set values, looks like a field (e.g., obj.Name = "John";).
	- Function: Performs an action or computation, called with parentheses (e.g., obj.GetName();).
	
- Q10. What are Namespaces?
Namespaces organize code into logical groups to avoid naming conflicts (e.g., using System; for console operations). Example: namespace MyApp { class Program { } }.

### OOPS & C# - Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation & Polymorphism

- Q11. What is Inheritance? When to use Inheritance?
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class (e.g., class Dog : Animal). Use it to reuse code or model "is-a" relationships (e.g., Dog is an Animal).

- Q12. What are the different types of Inheritance?
	- Single: One base class (e.g., class Dog : Animal).
	- Multilevel: Class inherits from a derived class (e.g., class Puppy : Dog : Animal).
	- Hierarchical: Multiple classes inherit from one base (e.g., Dog and Cat from Animal).
C# does not support multiple inheritance directly.
	
- Q13. Does C# support Multiple Inheritance? How to implement? 
C# does not support multiple inheritance for classes but supports it via interfaces (e.g., class MyClass : IInterface1, IInterface2).

- Q14. How to prevent a class from being Inherited?
Use the sealed keyword (e.g., sealed class MyClass).

- Q15. Are private class members inherited to the derived class? 
Yes, they are inherited but not accessible directly in the derived class.
- Q16. What is Abstraction? How to implement abstraction in real applications?
Abstraction hides implementation details, showing only essential features. Implement using abstract classes or interfaces (e.g., abstract class Shape { public abstract void Draw(); }).
- Q17. What is Encapsulation? How to implement encapsulation in real applications?
Encapsulation bundles data and methods, restricting access via private fields and public properties (e.g., private string _name; public string Name { get => _name; set => _name = value; }).
- Q18. What is the difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation?
	- Abstraction: Hides complexity, focuses on what an object does.
	- Encapsulation: Hides data, focuses on how data is protected.
- Q19. What is Polymorphism and what are its types? When to use polymorphism?
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their base type. Types:
	- Compile-time (Overloading): Same method name, different parameters.
	- Runtime (Overriding): Override base class method in derived class.
Use for flexibility in handling different object types.
- Q20. What is Method Overloading? In how many ways a method can be overloaded?
Method overloading uses the same method name with different parameters. Ways:
	- Different number of parameters.
	- Different types of parameters.
	- Different order of parameters.
- Q21. When should you use method overloading in real applications?
Use when methods perform similar tasks but with different inputs (e.g., Add(int a, int b) and Add(double a, double b)).
- Q22. If two methods have same except return type, then methods are overloaded?
No, methods cannot be overloaded by return type alone; parameter list must differ.
- Q23. What is the difference between Overloading and Overriding?
	- Overloading: Same method name, different parameters, same class.
	- Overriding: Redefine base class method in derived class using virtual and override.
- Q24. Use of Overriding? When should I override the method in real applications?
Overriding customizes base class behavior in derived classes. Use when derived classes need specific implementations (e.g., Dog.Bark() vs. Cat.Meow()).
- Q25. Method is marked as virtual, do we have to "override" it from the child base?
No, it’s optional. Use override in the child class if you want to provide a new implementation.
- Q26. What is the difference between Method Overriding and Method Hiding?
	- Overriding: Uses virtual/ override, dynamically binds to derived class method.
	- Hiding: Uses new, statically binds to base class method unless cast to derived type.
### OOPS & C# - Abstract Class & Interface
- Introduction
Abstract classes and interfaces define contracts for classes, promoting consistency and flexibility.
- Q27. What is the difference between an Abstract class and an Interface?
	- Abstract Class: Can have implementation, fields, and one base class (e.g., abstract class Shape { public abstract void Draw(); }).
	- Interface: Only method signatures, multiple inheritance (e.g., interface IDrawable { void Draw(); }).
- Q28. When to use Interface and when Abstract class in real applications?
	- Interface: When multiple classes share behavior but no common code (e.g., IDisposable).
	- Abstract Class: When classes share code and a common base (e.g., Animal with Move()).
- Q29. Why to create Interfaces in real applications?
Interfaces ensure contract adherence, enable loose coupling, and support multiple inheritance.
- Q30. Can we define body of Interfaces methods?
Yes, since C# 8.0, interfaces can have default implementations (e.g., void Method() { /* code */ }).
- Q31. Can you create an instance of an Abstract class or an Interface?
No, both are incomplete types and cannot be instantiated.
- Q32. Do Interface can have a Constructor?
No, interfaces cannot have constructors.
- Q33. Do abstract class have Constructors in C#?
Yes, abstract classes can have constructors to initialize fields, called by derived classes.
- Q34. What is the difference between abstraction and abstract class?
	- Abstraction: Concept of hiding details (via interfaces or abstract classes).
	- Abstract Class: A specific C# construct to achieve abstraction.
- Q35. Can Abstract class be Sealed or Static in C#?
No, abstract classes cannot be sealed (prevents inheritance) or static (no instances).
- Q36. Can you declare abstract methods as private in C#?
No, abstract methods must be public or protected to be overridden.
- Q37. Does Abstract class support multiple Inheritance?
No, C# does not support multiple inheritance for classes, only for interfaces.
- Mock Interview 1
Practice questions from this section to demonstrate understanding of abstract classes and interfaces.
### OOPS & C# - Access Specifiers, Boxing, Unboxing, String & StringBuilder
- Introduction
These concepts control access, manage type conversions, and handle string operations efficiently.
- Q38. What are Access Specifiers?
Access specifiers define the visibility of class members: public, private, protected, internal, protected internal.
- Q39. What is internal access modifier? Show example.
internal restricts access to the same assembly.
	```internal class MyClass { public void Method() { } }

```
- Q40. What is the default access modifier in a class?
	- For class: internal.
	- For class members: private.
- Q41. What is Boxing and Unboxing? Where to use them in real applications?
	- Boxing: Converting value type to object (e.g., int i = 10; object o = i;).
	- Unboxing: Converting object back to value type (e.g., int j = (int)o;).
Used when working with collections like ArrayList that store object.
- Q42. Which one is explicit Boxing or Unboxing?
Unboxing is explicit (requires casting, e.g., (int)o), while boxing is implicit.
- Q43. Is Boxing and Unboxing good for performance?
No, they cause performance overhead due to memory allocation and type casting. Use generics to avoid them.
- Q44. What are the basic string operations in C#?
	- Concatenation: string s = "Hello" + "World";
	- Length: s.Length
	- Substring: s.Substring(0, 5)
	- ToUpper/ToLower: s.ToUpper()
- Q45. What is the difference between “String” and “StringBuilder”?
	- String: Immutable, creates new instance on modification.
	- StringBuilder: Mutable, efficient for frequent modifications.
- Q46. When to use String and when StringBuilder in real applications?
	- String: For small, immutable text (e.g., "Hello").
	- StringBuilder: For dynamic string manipulation (e.g., appending in a loop).
- Q47. What is String Interpolation in C#?
String interpolation embeds expressions in strings using $ (e.g., string s = $"Name: {name}";).
### OOPS & C# - Loops, Conditions, Exception Handling
- Introduction
Loops, conditions, and exception handling manage program flow and errors effectively.
- Q48. What are the Loop types in C#? When to use what in real applications?
	- for: Known iteration count (e.g., for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)).
	- foreach: Iterate collections (e.g., foreach (var item in list)).
	- while: Condition-based (e.g., while (condition)).
	- do-while: Runs at least once (e.g., do { } while (condition);).
- Q49. What is the difference between “continue” and “break” statement?
	- continue: Skips to the next iteration.
	- break: Exits the loop entirely.
- Q50. What are the alternative ways of if-else conditions? When to use what?
	- Ternary Operator: For simple conditions (e.g., var x = a > b ? a : b;).
	- Switch Statement: For multiple conditions (e.g., switch (value) { case 1: ... }).
Use ternary for concise assignments, switch for readability with multiple cases.
- Q51. How to implement Exception Handling in C#?
Use try, catch, and finally:
	```try { /* code */ } catch (Exception ex) { /* handle error */ } finally { /* cleanup */ }

```
- Q52. Can we execute multiple Catch blocks?
Yes, but only the first matching catch block runs. Order from specific to general (e.g., catch (DivideByZeroException) before catch (Exception)).
- Q53. When to use Finally in real applications?
Use finally for cleanup tasks like closing files or database connections, ensuring they run regardless of exceptions.
- Q54. Can we have only “Try” block without “Catch” block?
Yes, with finally (e.g., try { } finally { }), but not alone.
- Q55. What is the difference between Finally and Finalize?
	- Finally: Part of try-catch, runs after try/catch for cleanup.
	- Finalize: Destructor method ( ~ClassName()), called by garbage collector.
- Q56. What is the difference between “throw ex” and “throw”?
	- throw ex: Resets stack trace, losing original error context.
	- throw: Preserves stack trace, better for debugging.
### OOPS & C# - Generics & Collections
- Introduction
Generics and collections enable type-safe, reusable data structures.
- Q57. Explain Generics in C#? When and why to use them?
Generics allow type-safe code without casting (e.g., List<T>). Use for reusable classes or methods (e.g., List<int> vs. ArrayList). Benefits: type safety, performance.
- Q58. What are Collections in C# and what are their types?
Collections store multiple items. Types:
	- Non-Generic: ArrayList, Hashtable.
	- Generic: List<T>, Dictionary<TKey, TValue>.
- Q59. What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
	- Array: Fixed size, strongly typed (e.g., int[] arr = new int[5];).
	- ArrayList: Dynamic size, stores object, requires boxing for value types.
- Q60. What is the difference between ArrayList and Hashtable?
	- ArrayList: Stores items in a list, accessed by index.
	- Hashtable: Stores key-value pairs, accessed by key.
- Q61. What is the difference between List and Dictionary Collections?
	- List: Ordered collection, accessed by index (e.g., List<int>).
	- Dictionary<TKey, TValue>: Key-value pairs, accessed by key (e.g., Dictionary<string, int>).
- Q62. What is IEnumerable in C#?
IEnumerable allows iteration over a collection (e.g., foreach). Implemented by List<T>, arrays, etc.
- Q63. What is the difference between IEnumerable and IEnumerator in C#?
	- IEnumerable: Provides method to get an enumerator (e.g., GetEnumerator()).
	- IEnumerator: Handles iteration with MoveNext() and Current.
- Q64. What is the difference between IEnumerable & IQueryable?
	- IEnumerable: In-memory data, executes locally.
	- IQueryable: Queryable data (e.g., database), executes on the server.

A constructor with parameters to initialize fields (e.g., public ClassName(string name) { Name = name; }).
- Q69. What is Static constructor? What is the use in real applications?
A static constructor initializes static members, called once per type (e.g., static ClassName() { }). Use for static field setup.
- Q70. Can we have parameters or access modifier in static constructor?
No, static constructors cannot have parameters or access modifiers.
- Q71. What is Copy constructor?
A constructor that creates an object by copying another (e.g., public ClassName(ClassName other) { Name = other.Name; }).
- Q72. What is Private constructor? What is the use?
A private constructor prevents instantiation (e.g., private ClassName() { }). Used in singleton patterns or static-only classes.
- Q73. What is Constructor overloading?
Defining multiple constructors with different parameters (e.g., ClassName() and ClassName(string name)).
- Q74. What is Destructor?
A destructor ( ~ClassName()) cleans up resources, called by the garbage collector. Rarely used due to IDisposable.
- Q75. Can you create object of class with private constructor in C#?
No, unless instantiated within the class (e.g., in a static method).
- Q76. If base & child both class have constructors, which will be called first?
Base class constructor is called first, then the child class constructor.
### OOPS & C# - Method Parameters, Delegates & Events
- Introduction
These features enable flexible method calls and event-driven programming.
- Q77. What is a Method in C#?
A method is a block of code that performs a task (e.g., public void SayHello() { Console.WriteLine("Hello"); }).
- Q78. Difference between Pass by Value and Pass by Reference Parameters?
	- Pass by Value: Copies value, changes don’t affect original (e.g., int x).
	- Pass by Reference: Passes memory address, changes affect original (e.g., ref int x).
- Q79. How to return more than one value from a method in C#?
Use out parameters, tuples, or a custom class:
	```(int sum, int count) GetStats() => (10, 5);

```
- Q80. What is the difference between “out” and “ref” parameters?
	- out: Must be assigned in method, no initial value needed.
	- ref: Must be initialized before passing, can be modified.

params allows variable number of arguments (e.g., void Sum(params int[] numbers)). Use for flexible method signatures.
- Q82. What are optional parameters in a method?
Parameters with default values (e.g., void Method(int x = 10)). Called without specifying optional arguments.
- Q83. What are named parameters in a method?
Specify parameter names when calling (e.g., Method(x: 5, y: 10)). Improves readability.
- Q84. What are extension Methods? When to use them?
Extension methods add functionality to existing types (e.g., public static bool IsEmpty(this string s) => s.Length == 0;). Use to extend third-party or sealed classes.

- Q90. What is the purpose of “using” keyword in C#?
	- Imports namespaces (e.g., using System;).
	- Disposes resources in a using block (e.g., using (var file = new StreamReader("file.txt"))).
- Q91. Can we use Using keyword with other classes apart from DB Connection?
Yes, with any class implementing IDisposable (e.g., StreamReader, HttpClient).
- Q92. What is the difference between “is” and “as” operators?
	- is: Checks type, returns bool (e.g., if (obj is string)).
	- as: Casts type, returns null if invalid (e.g., string s = obj as string;).
- Q93. What is the difference between “Readonly” and “Constant” variables?
	- readonly: Can be set at runtime (constructor), instance-level.
	- const: Set at compile-time, static.
- Q94. What is “Static” class? When to use it?
A static class contains only static members, cannot be instantiated (e.g., static class Utils). Use for utility methods.
- Q95. What is the difference between “var” and “dynamic” in C#?
	- var: Compile-time type inference (e.g., var x = 10; // int).
	- dynamic: Runtime type resolution, bypasses compile-time checks.
- Q96. What is Enum keyword used for?
enum defines a set of named constants (e.g., enum Days { Mon, Tue }). Use for fixed values.
- Q97. Is it possible to inherit Enum in C#?
No, enums cannot be inherited, but they implicitly inherit from System.Enum.
- Q98. What is the use of Yield keyword in C#?
